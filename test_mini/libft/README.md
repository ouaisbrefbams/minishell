libft is an extension/remake of the standard library.

This will produce a `libft.a` library which you can link to your project.

## Unit Test

make test
```

## Dependencies

* [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) - unit testing lib

Much like the `.gitignore` file, you can put the files/directory to ignore when compiling.

## Documentation

1. Install [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl/manual/install.html)
2. Run `make doc`
3. Open doc/html/index.html in your browser or read the man in doc/man/man3
